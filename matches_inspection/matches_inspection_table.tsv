BGC0000289#0	BGC0000289.0#0	to be corrected	Ilia->Alexey->Ilia	NEWER: Nerpa can fail due to weird assembly line and large distance between genes. Better leave it for now. NEW: all correct according to the paper. One minor note -- there is another entry for the same match in the table! Annotated as "bad" by Sasha below | OLD: (probably) incorrect assembly line; It looks like dbv17, dbv16 should be matched. Also, maybe X shouldn't have been truncated 	
BGC0001667#0	BGC0001667.4#0	good	Ilia->Alexey	NEW:  seems ok now, all genes are considered as should E->A->B->C, there are also PKS domains responsible for "Adda" (insertion in the alignment). Note that some modules are quite unspecific (B-1 & C-2 might attract a lot of different things); OLD: looks like correct assembly line is A, B, E, and C is silent. Why is that?

The remainig monomer X0 is linked to tioK, the original publication is not sure about it, there are several small genes involved in this non-standard amino acid synthesis and activation, maybe tioK, maybe tioJ and tioP (that is the idea of the paper authors); OLD:maybe first monomer should be skipped in alignment

BGC0002092#0	BGC0002092.4#0	to be corrected	Alexey	!! ignored all Condensation_Dual in BGC, that is why we got a lot of penalties for not matched chirality;  Also big pen for Glu->Asp 	
BGC0002484#0	BGC0002484.5#0	good	Alexey, Ilia	Big Penalty for Leu->Leu (sic!), seems like a pad prediction quality, incomplete aa34;   Also, one skipped X0 monomer, not clear how it was generated by BGC; Ilia: gene 15580 can't be included in the assembly line

BGC0001196#0	BGC0001196.0#0	bad	Alexey	Seems like we matched circular structure incorrectly, only half of BGCs predictions are reliable. Also maybe issues with chirality detection in NRP structure	
BGC0001018#0	BGC0001018.0#0	good	Alexey	Big penalty Glu->Unknown (in reality Ahp, 3-amion-6-hydroxy-2-piperidone), I think this is ok	
BGC0000416#0	BGC0000416.0#0	to be corrected	Alexey	Penality for NRP_SKIP, maybe it is iterative but hard to glue from BGC (there is one orphan C on the end of the third orf)

BGC0002572#0	BGC0002572.2#0	good	Alexey	Huge penalty for dhAbu -> Thr;  NRP monomer skipping seems reasonable, BGC has one extra PKS gene (single module), but I doubt it is relevant here

BGC0001414.0	BGC0001414.0	good	Alexey, Azat	X0 ignored in the structure ==> unnecessary BGC_Module_Skip.  Structures seems quite similar to Thr (BGC prediction)	
BGC0002293.0	BGC0002293.0	good	Alexey	huge penalty for Ph-Ser (unknown) -> Phe;  X0->unknown	
BGC0001005.1	BGC0001005.1	bad	Alexey	in reality (according to the BGC0001005 paper), the second gene (locB) is used iteratively. It is hard to get any clues about this from BGC (maybe only pending orphan C on the end of the gene..)	
BGC0000437.0	BGC0000437.0	for investigation	Alexey	there is a separate gene (Psyr_2611) with the missing Thr attracting domain which was NRP-MONOMER_SKIPPED in the structure Ilia: the assembly line is weird. It seems to be 8, then 11, although TE domain suggests 11, then 8	
BGC0001312.0	BGC0001312.0	to be corrected	Alexey	For whatever reason, two NRP monomers doesnt have corresponding BGC counterparts and properly skipped by Nerpa. The doi.org/10.1139/w01-017 doesnt help; Incorrect C_DUAL handling	
BGC0002581#5	BGC0002581.3	good	Alexey	New comment: everything looks good now (one gene with one A domain is not related and correctly skipped; strictly speaking it is related as aux gene synthesizing modified Tyr attracted by another A domain in the main gene but it is impossible to infer this info automatically). OLD COMMENT: It seems that we erroneously skipped one gene (4438.1) with two badly (?) predicted A domains and inserted 3 times NRP_skip_monomer	
BGC0002048.0	BGC0002048.0	to be corrected	Alexey	Note: marked "for inv" just becaused of C_Dual.  The rest is fine. This is the match with endopyrrole B, hence BGC_Module_skip. Version endopyrrole A has this extra monomer but it is cyclized, so maybe harder to match. 	
BGC0001667.2	BGC0001667.2	good	Alexey	Seems ok. Note: Dha (dehydroalanine) is related to serine/cysteine; Ilia: looks like correct assembly line is A, B, E, and C is silent. Why is that? Lesha: I checked the paper and wrote a detailed report here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LJwdTevDf4weg_uiTifIfzCV3Qq-IirLbbnNEp7e4Yk/edit (everything is working, no silent genes)	
BGC0001716.0	BGC0001716.0	to be corrected	Alexey	Important: we should have iterative A domain there! C-PCP in the end of the first gene. Also: For some reason, monomer plot in PNG contains many X monomers, while the alignment seems ok, everything is recognised	
BGC0001019.0	BGC0001019.0	bad	Alexey	Quite complex NRP-PKS hybrid	
BGC0002344.1	BGC0002344.1	was corrected	Alexey	Ok. Quite a complex chemical structure, and probably rBAN parsing failed to mark the first monomer as D- and Me-.
