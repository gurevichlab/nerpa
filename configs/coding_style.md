## Naming conventions
By default, standard coding style and naming conventions are used, as described in the Google Python Style Guide.

However, there are some exceptions to these rules or the cases where the rules don't say anything. 
In these cases, the following rules apply:
- If a name of a class contains a word that is an abbreviation, the abbreviation is written in uppercase letters, and all the words are separated by underscores (and still written in camel case). 
- In names of classes, *rBAN* is always written as *rBAN*.
 
For example, applying these rules, the name for the *parsed rBAN record* class would be *Parsed_rBAN_Record*.
